"""The code sensor — a model-less pipeline agent over the repo instrument.

Proves the agent platform's "code acts" half with zero inference: an agent is its declared
tools, wired at build time, every act attested. This one holds six handles — the git
instrument (read-only), the snapshot ledger, the attestor, (bp-012) the OBSERVED-only
observation store + its handoff seam, and (bp-013) the Lane-1 reference-edge store —
and nothing else: no model, no embedder, no vector
corpus, no network. It is the
same species as the vault watcher (`core/ingest/sync.py`), the deterministic-ingest agent
pattern, and deliberately NOT a factory-minted role: `PRE_DECLARED_MAX` holds no git or
store handle (§10), so instrument agents are wired by `build_*`, never minted. (bp-018
adds a seventh handle: the observation-history sidecar, so a bumped INTERPRETER_VERSION
can archive superseded generations instead of dropping them.)

Sensor framing (docs/brainstorms/code-as-sensor-stream.md): the repo is an instrument, the
commit stream is sensed data, `ops/code_snapshot.py` is the interpreter φ_code, the ledger
is the normalized ops-side record. CORRECTION (bp-012, ratified
docs/design-notes/code-observation-projection.md B-b): the stream is no longer
event-log-only — `sync()` now ALSO projects each newly-ingested commit into the observed
stratum, through the `CodeSensingHandoff` seam into the OBSERVED-only
`code_observations` store (symbol-grain, idempotent by (commit_sha, path, qualname),
attested `project_observations`). The LEDGER remains the ops-side record — build history,
reset-guarded; the OBSERVATIONS are corpus-side — the observed stratum, a reset target.
`sync()` keeps the watcher's rescan semantics: ledger-vs-history reconciliation, oldest
first, idempotent — a missed post-commit hook heals on the next invocation, and a no-op
sync is free. History backfill of observations is `backfill_observations()` — available,
deliberately NOT wired into sync (plan §11 parked decision: owner nod required).

Lane 1 (bp-013, B-c): the projection pass ALSO populates each observation's
`references_out` (validated code→corpus patterns) and mints typed doc↔code reference
edges — both directions — into the dedicated `ReferenceEdgeStore`
(`core/stores/reference_edges.py`), a store the balance math holds no handle to.
Extraction is mechanical (bp-011's measured-precision regexes verbatim); no model call
exists anywhere in this path.

φ_doc (bp-026, Item 20): the SAME projection pass also scans the corpus's OWN citation
graph — front-matter `design_ref`/`links`/`depends_on`/`warrant`/`supersedes`/
`superseded_by`, inline note-citations, and `[[wikilinks]]` — into `corpus_to_corpus`
edges, using the v2 symmetric `ReferenceEdgeStore` schema (bp-026 Item 18). Front-matter
is PARSED (a minimal YAML-subset parser scoped to this module — no project dependency on
PyYAML, per `pyproject.toml`'s "runtime deps are intentionally minimal"), never
regex-approximated (plan §10). Still fully mechanical; still no model anywhere in the path.

# earlier same-version re-pins (bp-026 φ_doc, bp-092 ledger captures; finding-0064): those
# touched ONLY the UNVERSIONED reference-edge lane / the ops ledger and left every code
# OBSERVATION byte-identical, so a bump would have spuriously re-projected the whole
# unchanged code_observations store. CI-3 is different: `extract_references` now takes a
# per-commit `known_corpus` index and DROPS a `note-citation` whose `docs/…md` target is
# absent from the tree at that commit (dn-code-ingest-pipeline §2.4-3, the `x.md`
# false-positive fix). That is a change to `references_out` -- the code→corpus half of the
# code OBSERVATION content that emit_batch hashes and mark_projected stamps under this
# version. Same commit, DIFFERENT versioned output ⇒ the doctrine's re-projection case
# exactly (plan Q5). Re-projection/backfill is OWED (backfill_observations() re-projects
# under 1.1.0, archiving the 1.0.0 generations to history) -- deliberately NOT run in the
# build session: the §11 parked owner-nod discipline (a normal sync projects only
# newly-ingested commits; history re-projection is the deliberate act).
#   NOTE: the NEW reference-edge patterns (dn-slug/finding-id/paired-§ shorthand, code_to_code
#   inherits/calls) are UNVERSIONED reference-edge additions (finding-0064's lane) and do NOT
#   enter `references_out` -- they mint edges only, gated OFF (ENABLED_L2B_PATTERNS) until the
#   M-C6 samples clear. So the bump is justified solely by the existence-check correction to
#   the observation projection; enabling the shorthand later mints no new observation content
#   and needs no further bump.
# An unbumped source change is a RED ratchet test (tests/unit/test_interpreter_versions.py),
# never silent; the sha256 pin is re-set at 1.1.0 there (orchestrator-verified attestation).

# ── Lane-1 reference extraction (B-c, bp-013 Item 7) — bp-011's VALIDATED patterns ONLY ──
# The V4 inventory (docs/build-plans/bp-011/inventory.json, `ranked_patterns_for_bp013`)
# measured per-(pattern, direction) precision on a stratified hand-check. Lane 1 is
# precision-first (a wrong deterministic edge is worse than a missing one; Lane 2 exists
# for fuzzy), so only the 100%-precision patterns are extracted:
#   KEPT:    note-citation (code→corpus, 4/4) · path-mention (code→corpus, 7/7)
#            · path-mention (corpus→code, 17/17)
#   DROPPED: wikilink (code→corpus, 0/5 — prose about [[...]] syntax, never a real link)
#            · symbol-mention (corpus→code, 1/5 — stdlib-shaped tokens, filenames-with-
#              dots, compound path.symbol needs its own pattern shape)
# The regexes are bp-011's probe patterns verbatim (docs/build-plans/bp-011/
# v4_reference_scan.py) — the measured precision belongs to THESE expressions; rewriting
# them would orphan the measurement. Targets are stored AS WRITTEN (no basename/proximity
# resolution — disambiguating a bare filename is consumer-side judgment, not Lane-1
# mechanics); a `:line` suffix on a corpus→code mention is stripped from the typed code
# endpoint (the endpoint is a path, not a path:line).
