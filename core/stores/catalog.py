"""Vault catalog — the active/tombstone ledger for incremental ingest (vault-sync task).

The Phase-1 ingest is content-addressed: identical bytes store once (raw is sacred). That
gives dedup for free but says nothing about *which source files currently hold which content*,
which is exactly what an incremental watcher needs to answer "unchanged?", "changed?",
"deleted?". This SQLite catalog is that map — `source_path -> (digest, active)` — and the
authority for the tombstone semantics (design-notes/vault-sync-and-capture.md):

  * **unchanged** — the file's current digest equals the recorded one and it is active → no-op.
  * **changed**   — a new digest → re-embed; the previous digest's derived rows are dropped
                    iff no other active file still references them.
  * **deleted**   — `tombstone()` marks the row inactive; derived rows are dropped, **raw is
                    kept** so a re-add dedups and nothing is lost.

It carries only local bookkeeping (paths, digests) — no note content, no network. All notes
the watcher records are `authored-solo` (the owner's own writing) — the §1 spectrum split is
now realized, so `Provenance.AUTHORED_SOLO` is the concrete tag (was the single `authored`).
Dialogue capture records `authored-dialogue` and curated ingest records `curated` through the
same catalog, by passing `provenance=` to `record`.
