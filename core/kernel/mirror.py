# OBJECT:    π_MR — the projection onto the mirror-readable layers MR (family 1).
# INVARIANT: in(Ω) ⊆ π_MR(V); observed/curated is unreachable to introspective agents Ω (I6).

"""The mirror projection as a TYPE (Invariant 6, BUILD-SPEC §8; gap G3).

I6 — the firewall — requires that introspective agents (the dreamer; the curator's theme /
contradiction scan) read ONLY the mirror-readable provenance classes
(`MIRROR_READABLE = {authored}`), so third-party observed exhaust can never seed a dream or
enter the behavioral baselines (§15). Until now that was a *call-site convention*: remember to
pass `provenances=MIRROR_READABLE` to `all_rows`. The formal-properties catalog (G3) asks to
promote it to **structural**.

`MirrorView` is that promotion. It is the only thing the introspective agents cluster over, and:

  * its sole *normal* constructor, `project`, applies π_MR — it reads the source restricted to
    `MIRROR_READABLE`; and
  * `__post_init__` re-validates every row's provenance and **raises** on a non-authored row,

so a `MirrorView` holding observed (or any non-MR) data **cannot be constructed at all** — not
by `project`, not by hand. Handing an introspective agent non-authored data is therefore
*unrepresentable* (the wrong state cannot be built), the top tier of the assurance hierarchy,
rather than "checked and refused". Functions typed to accept a `MirrorView` inherit the proof.

Note this is the *introspective* read path. The curator's prune scan deliberately reads ALL
provenances (orphaned derived weight is dead regardless of provenance); that is not a mirror
read and correctly does not go through `MirrorView`.
