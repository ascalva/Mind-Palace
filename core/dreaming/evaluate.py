# OBJECT:    the estimate/force seam (dn-synchronic-diachronic-dreamer §2.4 SD-4, N2) — the ONE
#            store-touching evaluator a dream dispatch holds. `force(grant, cut[, generation])` is
#            single point where rows become real (L2); `estimate` prices a force from metadata only
#            (L3); composition of scope expressions is symbolic and store-free (L1). The three gates
#            (admissibility, budget, cache) coincide on this one boundary — the closed-evaluator
#            condition, guard tier (honest label: conformance inventory + counting-fake tests, NOT a
#            structural v3 — SD-g parked).
# INVARIANT: the evaluator is the dispatch's ONLY store-touching capability (L2); every `force` is
#            preceded by an `estimate` and refused before ANY row read if the estimate exceeds the
#            budget (L3, rule-#8 kin); composing k expressions performs zero reads (L1). A store
#            handle not derivable from the evaluator is a `ConformanceError` (the red team).
# ENFORCED:  guard (tests/unit/test_materialization_boundary.py): a counting `RowSource` proves L1
#            zero-reads and L2 exactly-one-burst; an over-budget estimate refuses with zero reads
#            (L3, F-SD4a); no row is obtained without a force (F-SD4b); a direct handle raises.
"""The materialization boundary — estimate then force (dn-synchronic-diachronic-dreamer §2.4 SD-4).

Laziness is a *requirement* here, not an optimization (the owner's addendum, adopted as law): the
graph grows in size and time, so evaluation strategy is first-class. This module is the dispatch
layer's realization of three of the five laws:

  * **L1 — composition is symbolic; cost is O(expression).** A `ScopeExpression` composes scope
    operations (meet / restrict / anchor-shift) without touching a store. Composing k of them is
    pure `core.scope` arithmetic — zero row reads.
  * **L2 — one materialization boundary.** `Evaluator.force(grant, cut[, generation]) → readings` is
    the single seam where rows become real, and it applies the admissibility check at the same call.
    The evaluator is the dispatch's ONLY store-touching capability (the closed-evaluator condition);
    a store handle not derivable from it fails `assert_conforms` (guard tier — honestly labelled;
    the structural v3 is SD-g, parked).
  * **L3 — estimate-then-force (the refusal gate).** Every force is preceded by a `CostEstimate`
    computed from the *unevaluated* expression against an injected `StatsProvider` (metadata only —
    chain/node counts, grid sizes, eigensolve dims). The estimate is pure data computed core-side;
    the **refusal is machinery-side** (the model advises / code acts split, non-negotiable #3). An
    over-budget estimate refuses BEFORE a single row is read, reporting budget and estimate,
    quantified.

PURE-CORE: imports only `core.scope`, `core.agent_scope`, `core.mirror`, and `core.dreaming.charter`
— all pure-core. It reads no live store: `force` reads through an injected `RowSource` (the
`core.mirror` seam, reused — §2.5), and `estimate` reads through an injected `StatsProvider`. Wiring
a live stats source or a live row source is a LATER plan's call (Q4 parked); both are Protocols,
exercised by counting fakes.
