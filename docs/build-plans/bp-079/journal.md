# bp-079 journal

## 2026-07-21T02:40Z — minted at graduation (session-39, orchestrator)

Plan minted `proposed` from ratified `dn-synchronic-diachronic-dreamer` (§2.2/§2.4, D-0).
No build session yet. Awaiting the owner's item-by-item `proposed → ready` blessing (by hand).
Family: bp-079 → bp-080 (depends) ; bp-081 (parallel-ok) → bp-082 (capstone).

## 2026-07-20 — build session (opus builder, worktree, dispatched by session-39)

Contract read whole: CONSTITUTION, CLAUDE.md, CONVENTIONS, plan, design note. All §6 code
citations re-verified at worktree HEAD — every `path:line` matches (dreamer_scope
agent_scope:143-158; assert_conforms 191-215; ceiling roles.py:24-40 [PRE_DECLARED_MAX:24,
__post_init__:35-40]; meet scope.py:538-549; admissible/req_admissible 603-624; SLICE 527-536;
point windows 248-250; RowSource mirror.py:54-60; project 96-101). No spec-defect found; no
finding needed. Next free finding id confirmed 0127.

### Item 1 — DreamCharter + instrument ceiling — CLOSED (green)

`core/dreaming/charter.py` written. Contents:
- `Instrument(StrEnum)` registry (Q3 pre-answer): SIGMA_STAR_MST, CONDUCTANCE_PROFILE, CENSUS,
  PERSISTENCE — name-to-callable handles, no member demanded more than a name (no §10 finding).
- `INSTRUMENT_MAX = frozenset(Instrument)` — the ceiling.
- `Gauge(StrEnum)` {ANCHORED, RETRO, ARCHIVAL}; RETRO/ARCHIVAL are declared descriptors but parked.
- `Budget` dataclass (node/edge ceilings, eigensolve_dim_cap, walk_budget; non-negative guard).
- `DreamCharter.mint(owner_grant, strata, instruments, budget, gauge=ANCHORED)` composes grant =
  `owner_grant.meet(dreamer_scope(strata))` (ratified meet, NOT re-implemented). `__post_init__`
  refuses: instrument ⊄ INSTRUMENT_MAX (`InstrumentCeilingError`, refuse-not-clamp — falsifier
  covered); grant naming FOUNDATION (denylist ideal); grant not preserving `(READ,W_Σ=1,NONE)`;
  parked gauge (`NotImplementedError` naming SD-b).
- No store import (invariant held) — imports only core.scope + core.agent_scope.

Acceptance (`tests/unit/test_dream_charter.py`, 13 tests, all green):
- over-ceiling instrument raises at construction ✓ (+ explicit not-clamped-to-intersection test,
  the named falsifier) ✓
- grant == core.scope meet on fixtures ✓; monotone `grant ⊑ owner` ✓
- gauge defaults ANCHORED ✓; RETRO/ARCHIVAL construct-but-refuse matching "SD-b" ✓
- output authority (READ,W_Σ=1,NONE) ✓; W_Σ=0 owner grant refused ✓; FOUNDATION grant inadmissible ✓

### Items 2 & 3 — estimate/force seam (L1/L2) + refusal gate (L3) — CLOSED (green)

`core/dreaming/evaluate.py` written (both items, one file):
- `ScopeExpression` (L1) — symbolic composition (meet/restrict/anchor_shift + `compose` fold), pure
  core.scope arithmetic, store-free. NOTE: anchor_shift takes an optional `cut` — a downset over a
  base stratum is already multi-element (MIRROR pulls in MIRROR_AUTHORED), so a point-window
  anchor always carries a cut or SLICE fires (caught in test, fixed by threading cut through).
- `StatsProvider` Protocol (Q4 parked) — injected metadata surface, NO live wiring; fakes only.
- `CostEstimate` + `.over(budget)` — pure componentwise comparison, reads nothing.
- `Evaluator` (L2, closed-evaluator) — holds ONE RowSource (reused core.mirror.RowSource seam,
  §2.5 — DRY) + declared handle inventory. `estimate` (metadata only), `force` (the one boundary,
  applies admissibility at the same call), `materialize` (L3 gate: estimate→refuse-or-force).
- `BudgetRefusalError` (machinery-side, quantified) ; `assert_dispatch_conforms` wraps the ratified
  `assert_conforms` (guard tier, honest label — SD-g structural v3 parked).

Acceptance (`tests/unit/test_materialization_boundary.py`, 12 tests via counting fakes, all green):
- L1: composing k(=~10) expressions → src.reads == 0 ✓
- L2: force → exactly one read burst (src.reads == 1) ✓; multi-stratum cut-less force refused w/ 0
  reads ✓; honest handle inventory passes assert_conforms ✓; red-team direct store handle (OBSERVED
  ∉ grant) raises ConformanceError ✓
- L3 (F-SD4a): over-budget estimate refuses with 0 reads, message carries estimate(10000)+ceiling
  (1000) ✓; within-budget forces exactly once ✓; each budget dim independently refuses (3 params) ✓
- F-SD4b: no row obtained without a force event (compose=0, refuse=0, force=1) ✓
- CostEstimate.over is pure comparison ✓

No §10 stop-and-raise triggered: no core/scope.py or core/agent_scope.py edit needed; no instrument
member demanded more than a name-to-callable binding; no blessing. No findings filed.

### CI gate (local, on branch worktree-agent-af76e58699fa973df)

- ruff check . → All checks passed! (fixed ~39 E501 + 1 I001 in the new files, prose reflow only)
- scripts/check_imports.py → Import firewall (I2): OK — core imports no zone/networking module
- mypy core/dreaming/charter.py core/dreaming/evaluate.py → Success: no issues found in 2 files
  (core Tier-1 strict); mypy on both new test files → Success, 0 errors (adds nothing to tests
  baseline)
- python -m ops.type_gate → Tier-2 membership OK; Bare-ignore scan OK
- pytest (green gate, `-m 'not live and not podman and not needs_vault and not needs_restic'`,
  deselecting the finding-0103 ratchet `test_core_imports_nothing_outside_core`) →
  1706 passed, 11 skipped, 21 deselected. IMPORTANT: my two new core modules import ONLY core
  (scope/agent_scope/mirror/dreaming.charter) — they are NOT in the ratchet's inversion list, so
  the ratchet count is unchanged by this build.

All three items closed, all acceptance criteria + named falsifiers green. Scope confined to the
four write_scope globs + this journal. Committing on branch; NOT merging (orchestrator seals).
